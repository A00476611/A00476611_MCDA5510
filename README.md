Hi I'm D'Shon Henry. I'm a student of the MCDA program from Barbados. My preferred email is dshon.henry@smu.ca and my A# is A00476611.<br>
My group got together based on our shared love of drinking coffee. The members of my group include: me, Carmen and Weilin. <br>
Carmen is from Hong Kong. She took MCDA because she would like to enhance her technical skills. Additionally,  the internship opportunities in this program allow her to gain working experiences and build her network in Canada. She likes lots of milk in her coffee and a fun fact about her is that she likes drawing and design.<br>
Weilin is from China. He chose the MCDA program because he likes the program's structure, it covers all the skills we might need in the industry and even has co-op terms. Also, he believes he can learn alot from everyone in our cohort because of our collective years of experience. A fun fact about him is that he likes walking instead of taking bus or driving. He hates cold coffee.
